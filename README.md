# Professional Portfolio

This page was originally a small portfolio page completed early on in the full stack web development boot camp I completed.
<br>
After the finishing, it was first a portfolio page I used to show case my development projects but since then I've chosen to utilize it in showcasing myself and my career transition into Project management.
